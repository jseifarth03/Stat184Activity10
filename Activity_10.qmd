# Question 1

  y <- (cos(4*x) + tan(0.5*x))^4
  return(y)
}

ggplot() +
  stat_function(

    n = 1000
  ) +

  labs(
    x = "x",

  )
```

# Question 2
```{r}
data(diamonds)

ggplot(diamonds) +
  aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = clarity) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle open") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdYlGn", direction = 1) +

    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12L),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12L)
  )

```

# Question 3[^1]
```{r}
# Loading in the CSV and viewing its head
tortilla <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\jsei8\\Downloads\\tortilla_data.csv", header = TRUE)
head(tortilla)
```

## Question 3.a
```{r}
# Filter the tortilla data frame by year
avg2007 <- tortilla %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  #Calculate the mean and summarize
  summarize(avgPrice2007 = mean(price))

print(avg2007)
```

## Question 3.b
```{r}
# Filter the tortilla data frame by year
avg2024 <- tortilla %>%
  filter(year == 2024) %>%
  #Calculate the mean and summarize
  summarize(avgPrice2024 = mean(price))

print(avg2024)
```

## Question 3.c
```{r}
#Pull the averages from respective data frames then subtract
avgDif <- avg2024$avgPrice2024 - avg2007$avgPrice2007
print(avgDif)
```

## Question 3.d

##### Average Price of Tortillas Over Time
```{r}
# Group the data by year then calculate average prices
tortillaAvgs <- tortilla %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avgPrice = mean(price))

# Plot the data with X as year and Y as average price
ggplot(tortillaAvgs) +
  aes(x = year, y = avgPrice) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Price") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Question 3.e
```{r, results='asis'}
# Filtering the data by year and summarizing the average after grouping by state
stateSummary <- tortilla %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(price2016 = mean(price))
```

##### Table of Average Tortilla Prices by State in 2016
```{r}
# Creating the table using Knitr package
kable(stateSummary, col.names = c("State", "Average Price"), digits = 2)
```

##### Box Plot of 2016 Tortilla Prices By State
```{r}
# Sort the data by year
stateSummaryLong <- tortilla %>%
  filter(year == 2016)

# Create box plots seperated by state
ggplot(stateSummaryLong) +
  aes(x = state, y = price) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#91A9D2") +
  labs(
    x = "State",
    y = "Price",
    caption = "Data only collected in states bordering the USA"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Question 3.f

##### Box Plots of Store Type in Neuvo Leon From 2007 - 2024
```{r}
# Filter data by state Nuevo Leon
stateSummaryNuevoLeon <- tortilla %>%
  filter(state == "NuevoLeon")

# Create box plots faceted by year
ggplot(stateSummaryNuevoLeon) +
 aes(x = storeType, y = price) +
 geom_boxplot(fill = "#8AB0F2") +
 labs(x = "Store Type", 
 y = "Price") +
 theme_minimal() +
 facet_wrap(vars(year)) +
  # Rotating x axis by 90 degrees
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```
From these box plots, we can deduce that the difference in price between Mom and Pop stores and Large Retail gets greater over time. They may still be proportional to each other because the overall prices rise, but the difference appears to grow.
